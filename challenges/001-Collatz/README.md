# Challenge 001: Collatz

[Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) 
is a hypothesis that given a natural number *x*, the sequence generated by the following rule shall reach 1 at some point.
```
If x is an even number, the next number is x / 2.
If x is an odd number, the next number is 3x+1.
```

For example: starting from 3, the sequence generated can be written as the following:
```
[3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1]
```
another example, starting from 15,
```
[15,46,23,70,35,106,53,160,80,40,20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1]
```

**Objective**: By writing a program,
find the smallest initial value *n* such that the "Collatz sequence" generated has 101 terms.
