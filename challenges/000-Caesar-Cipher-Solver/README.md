# Challenge 000: Caesar Cipher Solver

[Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is one of the earliest attempts to cryptography,
by shifting letters by some fixed number.

For example: the text
```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```
shifted by 2 would be:
```
Vjg swkem dtqyp hqz lworu qxgt vjg ncba fqi
```

As you can see, the letter *T* was mapped to *V*, *h* was mapped to *j*, etc.

**Objective**: By writing a program and using Google (or your history knowledge),
determine what famous historical document the [ciphertext.txt](ciphertext.txt) is.

## Info
* Suggested language: Any programming language capable of IO.
* Difficulty: Easy if higher level language, medium if lower level language.
