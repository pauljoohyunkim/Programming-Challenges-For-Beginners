# Challenge 003: Fibonacci

[Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) 
is a sequence {f(n)} generated by the following rules:
```
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n > 3
```


**Objective**: Compute the following:
```
f(1) + f(2) + ... + f(15)
```


## Info
* Topics: Recursion
* Difficulty: A classic, one of the simplest non-trivial example of recursion.
